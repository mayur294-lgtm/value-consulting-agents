## Value Levers

### 1. Branch Transaction Migration

**Mechanism:** Shift routine transactions from branches to digital channels, reducing per-transaction cost.

**Formula:**
```
Annual Savings = (Branch Tx Volume) × (Migration %) × (Branch Cost - Digital Cost)
```

**Channel Cost Benchmarks (LATAM USD):**

| Channel | Cost per Transaction | Volume Trend |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| Branch (Sucursal) | $4.00-5.00 | Flat/Declining |
| Call Center (CAT) | $3.00-4.00 | Declining |
| WhatsApp | $1.25-1.75 | Growing 80%+ CAGR |
| IVR | $0.75-1.25 | Declining |
| Digital (BOL/App) | $0.25-0.40 | Growing 30%+ CAGR |
| Kiosk | $0.50-1.00 | Growing |
| ATM | $0.75-1.25 | Stable |

**Typical Migration Assumptions:**

| Channel | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Branch to Digital | 5% | 15% | 25% |
| Call Center to Digital | 10% | 25% | 40% |
| WhatsApp to App | 5% | 15% | 25% |

### 2. Digital Adoption Growth

**Mechanism:** New digital capabilities drive organic channel shift beyond migrations.

**Transaction Volume CAGR Benchmarks (LATAM):**

| Channel | Typical CAGR |
|---------|--------------|
| Digital (BOL/App) | 25-35% |
| WhatsApp | 60-90% |
| Kiosk/Self-Service | 100-160% |
| Branch | 2-5% |
| Call Center | -5% to -10% |
| IVR | -30% to -50% |

### 3. Backbase Effectiveness Model

**Implementation Ramp:**

| Factor | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Implementation % | 30% | 80% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Adoption Rate | 25% | 50% | 60% | 70% | 80% |
| YoY Growth Factor | 0% | 7% | 7% | 7% | 7% |

**Combined Effect:** Multiply (Implementation %) × (Adoption Rate) for benefit realization.

### Transaction Volume Profile (Mid-Size LATAM Retail Bank)

| Channel | Annual Transactions | % of Total |
|---------|---------------------|------------|
| Digital/BOL | 750K-1M | 20-25% |
| Branch | 900K-1.1M | 30-35% |

| Kiosk | 150-200K | 5-8% |
| **Total** | **3-3.5M** | **100%** |

### Cost Savings Potential

| Migration Type | Volume Migrated | Savings/Tx | Annual Savings |
|----------------|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| Branch → Digital | 100K | $3.70 | $370K |
| Call Center → Digital | 50K | $2.90 | $145K |
| WhatsApp → App | 100K | $1.10 | $110K |
| **Total** | **250K** | **Avg $2.50** | **$625K** |

## Sensitivity Factors

1. **Exchange Rate Volatility:** LATAM currencies fluctuate; model in local currency, convert at point-in-time
2. **Inflation:** High inflation markets require inflation-adjusted projections
3. **Digital Adoption Curve:** Varies significantly by country (Chile/Brazil ahead, others lagging)
4. **Branch Footprint:** Banks with large rural networks have different economics
