## Value Levers

### 1. RM Time Savings (Operational Efficiency)

**Mechanism:** Reduce administrative time per RM through automated entitlements, streamlined workflows, and unified client views.

**Formula:**
```
Annual Savings = (# RMs) × (Admin Hours/Week) × (52 weeks) × (Reduction %) × (RM Hourly Cost)

RM Hourly Cost = Annual Loaded Cost / 2080 hours
```

**Typical Inputs:**

| Parameter | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive |
|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|
| Admin Hours/Week per RM | 6-8 | 8-10 | 10-15 |
| Admin Time Reduction | 40% | 50-60% | 70% |
| RM Loaded Cost | $150-200K | $180-220K | $200-300K |

**Benchmark Range:** $15K-30K savings per RM annually

---

### 2. IT Support Reduction (Technology Cost Optimization)

**Mechanism:** Reduce support tickets and manual interventions through self-service capabilities and simplified access management.

**Formula:**
```
Annual Savings = (IT Support FTEs) × (Reduction %) × (IT FTE Loaded Cost)
```

**Typical Inputs:**

| Parameter | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive |
|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|
| IT Support FTE Reduction | 25% | 40% | 50% |
| IT FTE Loaded Cost | $100-120K | $110-130K | $120-150K |

---

### 3. Platform Consolidation Savings

**Mechanism:** Eliminate or reduce licenses for redundant systems (CRM, portal, workflow tools).

**Formula:**
```
Annual Savings = (Seats Eliminated) × (Cost per Seat)
```

**Common Consolidation Targets:**

| System | Typical Cost/Seat | Reduction Potential |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| CRM (Salesforce, etc.) | $2,500-4,000/yr | 20-40% seats |
| Legacy Portal | $500-1,500/yr | 80-100% |
| Workflow Tools | $300-800/yr | 50-70% |

---

### 4. Client Retention Revenue

**Mechanism:** Improve client retention through better digital experience, proactive insights, and reduced friction.

**Formula:**
```
Annual Revenue = (# Clients) × (Retention Improvement %) × (Avg AUM) × (Revenue Rate)
```

**Typical Inputs:**

| Parameter | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive |
|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|
| Retention Improvement | 1% | 2% | 3-4% |
| Avg Client AUM | $5-15M | $10-25M | $15-50M |
| Revenue Rate (bps) | 50-75 | 75-100 | 100-150 |

**Note:** This lever has the highest potential value but also highest assumption sensitivity.

## Ramp-Up Assumptions

| Factor | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Implementation % | 25% | 75% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Adoption Rate | 25% | 50% | 75% | 85% | 90% |
| Combined Factor | 6% | 38% | 75% | 85% | 90% |

---

## Investment Considerations

### One-Time Costs

| Component | Range |
|-----------|-------|
| Platform License | $500K-2M |
| Implementation Services | $800K-2.5M |
| Data Migration | $150-400K |
| Change Management | $200-500K |
| **Total One-Time** | **$1.5M-5M** |

### Ongoing Annual Costs

| Component | Range |
|-----------|-------|
| Platform Subscription | $300K-1M |
| Support & Maintenance | $150-400K |
| Internal Resources | $200-500K |
| **Total Annual** | **$650K-2M** |

---

## Sensitivity Analysis

**Key Driver:** Client Retention Improvement assumption has 3-4x impact on total value compared to operational savings.

| Scenario | Retention Assumption | 5-Year Value |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|
| Conservative | 1% | $8-12M |
| Base | 2% | $15-25M |
| Optimistic | 3% | $25-40M |

**Recommendation:** Always present range; use conservative for commitment, base for planning.
