| 9 | **Customer Servicing** | Retain | **$5.03M** | $0 | $610K | $928K | $1.30M | $2.20M |

### Key Calculation: Retention Lever (L4)

| Step | Calculation | Value |
|------|------------|-------|
| Total active customers | Given | 2,896,296 |
| Current churn rate | Assumption | 6% |
| Customers at risk of churn | 2,896,296 × 6% | 173,778 |
| Backbase Impact (churn prevented) | 10% | 17,378 customers retained |
| Avg income per customer | $61.50 | — |
| Annual benefit at full effectiveness | 17,378 × $61.50 | **$1.07M** |
| Loading: 0% Y1, ramps from Y2 | Churn curve | See below |

### Key Calculation: Product Upsell Lever (L5)

| Step | Calculation | Value |
|------|------------|-------|
| Digitally inactive customers | 2,896,296 - 750,000 | 2,146,296 |
| Backbase Impact (% activated) | 5% | 107,315 customers |
| Avg income per additional product | $36.90 (deposit-weighted) | — |
| Annual benefit at full effectiveness | 107,315 × $36.90 | **$3.96M** |

### Key Calculation: CC Origination Lever (L3)

| Step | Calculation | Value |
|------|------------|-------|
| Intent to purchase CC (annual) | 150,000 (5× actual online CC orders) | — |
| Current leakage rate | 80% | 120,000 lost |
| Backbase Impact (leakage reduction) | 5% | 6,000 new CC customers |
| Avg income per CC customer | $73.80 | — |
| Annual benefit at full effectiveness | 6,000 × $73.80 | **$443K** |

### Loading/Effectiveness Curves (Moderate Scenario)

| Category | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Acquisition — Implementation | 0% | 60% | 75% | 90% | 100% |
| Acquisition — Effectiveness | 0% | 30% | 45% | 55% | 60% |

| Servicing — Effectiveness | 0% | 50% | 60% | 70% | 80% |

**Note:** All curves start at 0% Y1 — MSB has an implementation-first year with no benefit realization until Y2.

### Key Assumptions

1. **Currency:** 1 VND = 4.2×10⁻⁵ USD
2. **Churn rate:** 6% (assumption — validate with client)
3. **Digitally active:** 750K of 2.9M customers (26%)
4. **CC intent volume:** 150K (5× actual online orders — assumption)
5. **YoY customer growth:** 14% (acquisition), 12% (servicing)

## Example 5: Wealth Management — RM Productivity & Share of Wallet Focus

**Region:** Composite (based on HNB Sri Lanka + Goodbody Ireland patterns)
**Segment:** Wealth Management
**Primary Focus:** RM Productivity, Share of Wallet, Product Penetration
**Reference Files:** `knowledge/learnings/roi_models/wealth_entitlements_roi.md`, `knowledge/MSB - RB ROI Assessment.xlsx` (methodology), `knowledge/domains/investing/roi_levers.md`

> **Why this example matters:** Demonstrates a wealth engagement where the dominant value levers are RM time freed and AUM growth — NOT client onboarding volume. Onboarding is a minor lever here; the ROI is driven by expanding existing relationships.

### Typical Wealth Engagement Profile

| Metric | Typical Range |
|--------|---------------|
| RM headcount | 50-200 |
| AUM per RM | $30-100M |
| Clients per RM | 80-150 |
| Fee on AUM | 0.5-1.5% blended |
| RM fully loaded cost | $80-350K/year (region-dependent) |
| New onboardings/year | 200-500 |
| Time on admin tasks | 40-60% of RM day |

### Value Levers — Wealth-Specific

#### L1: RM Productivity (Cost Avoidance + Capacity Creation) — **Primary Lever**

This is typically the largest lever in wealth engagements.

| Step | Calculation | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| RM headcount | Given | 100 RMs |
| Admin time per RM per day | Discovery finding | 5.4 hours |
| Backbase Impact (admin time reduced) | 40% reduction | 2.16 hours freed/day |
| Hours freed per RM per year | 2.16 × 250 working days | 540 hours/year |
| RM hourly cost | Fully loaded ÷ 2000 hours | $175/hour |
| Annual value per RM | 540 × $175 | $94,500 |
| **Total annual benefit** | 100 RMs × $94,500 | **$9.45M** |

**What admin time includes:** Portfolio review prep, compliance documentation, report generation, manual data entry, cross-system lookups, email-based client requests.

**Loading curve:** Faster than retail — RMs adopt productivity tools quickly when they see time savings.

| Year | Implementation | Effectiveness | Realized |
|------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| Y1 | 20% | 15% | $283K |
| Y2 | 70% | 35% | $2.31M |
| Y3 | 80% | 60% | $4.54M |
| Y4 | 100% | 85% | $8.03M |
| Y5 | 100% | 100% | $9.45M |

#### L2: Share of Wallet / AUM Growth (Revenue Uplift) — **Secondary Lever**

| Step | Calculation | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Total AUM | Given | $5B |
| Fee on AUM | Blended rate | 1.0% |
| Current fee revenue | $5B × 1% | $50M |
| Backbase Impact (AUM consolidation) | 5% of AUM moved from competitors | $250M additional AUM |
| Annual revenue uplift | $250M × 1% | **$2.5M** |

**Mechanism:** Digital self-service portfolio overview + ACAT transfer tools + proactive alerts encourage clients to consolidate assets from other custodians.

**Loading curve:** Slow — asset consolidation requires trust built over 12-24 months.

| Year | Realized |
|------|----------|
| Y1 | $0 |
| Y2 | $375K |
| Y3 | $750K |
| Y4 | $1.5M |
| Y5 | $2.5M |

#### L3: Product Penetration — Banking-to-Investing Cross-sell (Revenue Uplift)

| Step | Calculation | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Mass affluent banking customers | Eligible for wealth upgrade | 10,000 |
| Current conversion to wealth | Annual rate | 2% (200 clients) |
| Backbase Impact (improved targeting + digital) | +3% conversion | 300 additional clients |
| Avg new NNA per converted client | Net new assets | $150K |
| Fee on NNA | Blended | 1.0% |
| Annual revenue | 300 × $150K × 1% | **$450K** |

#### L4: Client Onboarding Efficiency (Cost Avoidance) — Minor Lever

| Step | Calculation | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| New onboardings per year | 250 | — |
| Current time per onboarding | RM (3h) + Assistant (1h) + Back Office (1h) | 5 hours total |
| Blended hourly rate | $125 | — |
| Current annual cost | 250 × 5 × $125 | $156K |
| Backbase Impact (40% reduction) | | **$63K** |

**Note:** In wealth, onboarding efficiency is a real but **minor** lever ($63K vs $9.45M for RM productivity). Leading with onboarding in a wealth engagement would be misleading.

### Composite 5-Year Summary

| Lever | Type | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 | Total |
|-------|------|-----|------|------|------|------|-------|
| RM Productivity | Cost avoidance | $283K | $2.31M | $4.54M | $8.03M | $9.45M | $24.6M |
| AUM Growth | Revenue uplift | $0 | $375K | $750K | $1.5M | $2.5M | $5.13M |
| Product Penetration | Revenue uplift | $0 | $68K | $135K | $270K | $450K | $923K |
| Onboarding Efficiency | Cost avoidance | $9K | $22K | $38K | $54K | $63K | $186K |
| **Total** | | **$292K** | **$2.78M** | **$5.46M** | **$9.85M** | **$12.5M** | **$30.8M** |

### Key Assumptions

1. **RM admin time:** 5.4 hours/day on non-value tasks (validate via time study or discovery)
2. **AUM consolidation:** 5% is conservative; digital-first wealth platforms see 8-12% in mature markets
3. **Mass affluent conversion:** 2% current rate is typical; Backbase digital engagement can push to 5%
4. **Fee rate:** 1% blended; varies by product mix (advisory vs discretionary vs execution-only)
5. **Discount rate:** 12% (typical wealth management WACC)
6. **RM cost:** Highly region-dependent — validate against client data

## ROI Model Template Structure

### Standard Value Levers

#### 1. Customer Acquisition / Onboarding
- Digital conversion rate improvement
- Funnel leakage reduction
- Time-to-onboard reduction
- FTE capacity freed

#### 2. Loan / Product Origination
- STP rate improvement
- Decision time reduction
- FTE processing costs
- Revenue per funded account

#### 3. Customer Servicing
- Call/branch deflection
- Self-service adoption
- First-call resolution
- Cost per interaction

#### 4. Loyalty & Retention

**Churn Reduction** — revenue retained by preventing customer attrition:

| Input | Description | Example (Bank A) | Example (MSB) |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Total active customers | Current customer base | 86,000 | 2,896,296 |
| Current churn rate | Annual attrition % | 28% | 6% |
| Avg income per customer | Blended annual revenue | $707 | $61.50 |
| Backbase Impact | % churn prevented via digital engagement | 10% | 10% |

**Formula:** `Annual benefit = Total customers × Churn rate × BB impact × Avg income`
- Bank A: 86,000 × 0.28 × 0.10 × $707 = **$1.70M/year at full effectiveness**
- MSB: 2,896,296 × 0.06 × 0.10 × $61.50 = **$1.07M/year at full effectiveness**

**Loading curve:** Delayed — typically 0% Y1, ramps from Y2 as digital engagement builds trust and habit.

| Year | Implementation | Effectiveness | Realized Benefit (Bank A) |
|------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Y1 | 30% | 0% | $0 |
| Y2 | 100% | 40% | $388K |
| Y3 | 100% | 60% | $486K |
| Y4 | 100% | 80% | $626K |
| Y5 | 100% | 100% | $851K |

**Product Penetration / Cross-sell** — revenue from activating inactive digital customers:

| Input | Description | Example (Bank A) | Example (MSB) |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Digitally inactive customers | Customers not using digital | 55,000 | 2,146,296 |
| Avg income per additional product | Revenue from cross-sell | $100 | $36.90 |
| Backbase Impact | % customers activated/cross-sold | 10% | 5% |

**Formula:** `Annual benefit = Inactive customers × BB impact × Avg income per product`
- Bank A: 55,000 × 0.10 × $100 = **$550K/year at full effectiveness**
- MSB: 2,146,296 × 0.05 × $36.90 = **$3.96M/year at full effectiveness**

**Loading curve:** Same as churn — 0% Y1, builds with digital adoption.

#### 5. IT Cost Savings

**Legacy System Decommission** — cost avoided by retiring systems replaced by Backbase:

| Input | Description | Example (Bank A) |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Number of legacy systems | Systems to be decommissioned | Up to 15 |
| Annual license cost per system | Software licensing | $100,000 |
| Annual hosting/maintenance per system | Infrastructure + ops | $50,000 |
| Total annual legacy cost | Full cost stack | $2.25M |

**Formula:** `Annual savings = Σ(License + Hosting + Maintenance) per system × BB effectiveness`

**Loading curve:** Step-function tied to decommission milestones, not gradual adoption.

| Year | BB Effectiveness | Annual Savings | Cumulative |
|------|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| Y1 | 30% (partial migration) | $675K | $675K |
| Y2 | 100% (full cutover) | $2.25M | $2.93M |

**Cost components to inventory:**
- Customer/vendor licenses (per-user, per-seat, per-instance)
- Managed hosting and infrastructure
- Annual maintenance and support contracts
- Internal FTEs dedicated to legacy support
- Parallel-run period costs (3-6 months overlap before full decommission)
- Termination penalties (one-time; deduct from savings)

**Reference:** See `knowledge/learnings/roi_models/tech_rationalization_decommission.md` for the OneAZ/Lumin case study ($6.65M annual legacy spend, 80%+ savings potential).
