## Backbase Value Themes for Investing

### 1. Capture the Investment Wallet (Bank-Led)

**The Problem:**
Banking clients invest their money elsewhere — Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, Robinhood. The bank has the deposit relationship but loses the investment relationship (and the fee revenue that comes with it). Typical banking-to-investing conversion is <3%.

**Backbase Solution:**
Integrated banking + investing experience via Digital Banking + Digital Invest. NBA engine in Digital Engage identifies eligible clients and triggers contextual prompts. Digital Onboarding pre-populates from banking profile — zero re-entry.

**Quantified Value:**
| Metric | Typical Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|
| Banking-to-investing conversion | +2-5% (from <3% baseline) |
| Average initial AUM captured | $5K-$15K per conversion |
| Incremental fee revenue | Driven by AUM × fee rate (25-50 bps) |

### 2. Activate and Engage Investors Digitally

**The Problem:**
30-50% of opened investment accounts never make a first trade. Funded accounts sit dormant because investors lack guidance, confidence, or a compelling reason to act. Every dormant account is zero revenue.

**Backbase Solution:**
Digital Invest with guided first-investment journeys, robo-advisory for those who want hands-off, goal-based investing that makes it personal. Digital Engage drives activation sequences — "You're funded. Here's your first step."

**Quantified Value:**
| Metric | Typical Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|
| First-trade rate (within 30 days) | +20-30% (from 40-50% baseline) |
| Recurring investment setup | +15-25% |
| Robo enrollment from self-directed | 5-10% conversion |

### 3. Reduce Cost of Investor Acquisition & Servicing

**The Problem:**
Manual account opening costs $250-500. Ongoing servicing through call centers and advisors adds $100-200/account/year. At scale, this limits profitability — especially for smaller accounts.

**Backbase Solution:**
Digital Onboarding with STP (suitability, KYC, funding in one flow). Self-service for routine operations via Digital Invest. AI & Agentic for common questions. Digital Assist for advisor efficiency in hybrid model.

**Quantified Value:**
| Metric | Typical Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|
| Cost per account opened | -60-80% (manual → digital) |
| Call deflection rate | +20-40% |
| Advisor admin time reduction | -30-50% |

### 4. Grow AUM Through Digital Engagement

**The Problem:**
Inactive investors don't add money. Without prompts, reminders, and goal tracking, investors forget about their accounts or spread new investments across competitors.

**Backbase Solution:**
Digital Engage drives recurring investment prompts, IRA contribution deadline reminders, excess-cash-in-savings alerts. Digital Invest goal tracking shows progress and encourages top-ups. Data Foundations enables behavioral triggers.

**Quantified Value:**
| Metric | Typical Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|
| AUM uplift (engaged vs non-engaged) | 10-25% |
| ACAT transfer-in completion | +10-20% |
| Recurring investment adoption | +15-25% |

### 5. Retain Investors Through Market Cycles

**The Problem:**
Market downturns trigger panic. Without proactive, segmented communication, investors sell at the bottom, call the support center in a surge, or transfer assets to competitors they perceive as "safer."

**Backbase Solution:**
Digital Engage for automated, segmented market volatility communications. Digital Invest for portfolio context ("Your portfolio is down 5%, but you're still ahead of your 10-year target"). Digital Assist for seamless advisor escalation with full context.

**Quantified Value:**
| Metric | Typical Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|
| Retention improvement | +1-3% annually |
| Support surge reduction during volatility | -30-50% |
| AUM protected per downturn cycle | Significant — depends on book size |

## Competitive Differentiation

| Competitor | Their Approach | Backbase Differentiation |
|------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Core banking vendors (FIS, Fiserv, JackHenry) | Brokerage as bolt-on to banking | Backbase: engagement layer that unifies banking + investing experience |
| Wealth platforms (Temenos WealthSuite, Avaloq) | Advisor-led, HNW-focused | Backbase: mass-market, digital-first, self-service with hybrid upgrade path |
| Neobrokers (Robinhood, eToro) | Pure digital, no banking integration | Backbase: bank-grade compliance + modern UX + banking relationship advantage |
| Robo-only (Betterment, Wealthfront) | Single product (managed portfolios) | Backbase: full lifecycle from banking through self-directed to managed to advisory |

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We use a third-party brokerage platform" | Backbase sits on top as the engagement layer — we enhance, not replace. Think of it as the experience wrapper around your brokerage operations. |
| "Our investors are happy with Schwab/Fidelity" | That's exactly the problem — they're your banking clients but Schwab's investing clients. Backbase helps you capture that wallet before it leaves. |
| "Investing is too regulated for digital" | Our Digital Onboarding includes suitability, KYC, eConsent, and audit trail — designed for SEC/FINRA/MiFID compliance. Digital doesn't mean unregulated. |
| "We don't have the AUM to justify investment" | The ROI is primarily from banking-to-investing conversion and cost reduction — even modest conversion of your existing client base generates material fee revenue. |
