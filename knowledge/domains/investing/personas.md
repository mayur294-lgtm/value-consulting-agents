# Investing Domain Personas

## Overview

These personas span both entry models (pure investing provider and bank-led investing). Adapt names and demographic details to the specific client's market.

---

## Persona 1: The First-Timer

**Profile:** 22-35, employed, some savings, never invested before. Intimidated by financial markets but knows they should start.

**Goals:**
- Start investing without feeling stupid
- Build wealth gradually with minimal effort
- Understand what's happening with their money

**Pain Points:**
- Overwhelmed by choices (thousands of stocks/ETFs)
- Intimidated by financial jargon (P/E ratio, NAV, expense ratio)
- Fear of losing money — analysis paralysis
- Doesn't know the difference between account types

**Behavior:**
- Researches on social media (Reddit, TikTok, YouTube) before acting
- Wants mobile-first, simple experience
- Prefers robo-advisory or goal-based investing over self-directed
- Small initial investment ($100-$1K), grows over time

**What wins them:**
- Guided experience: "Tell us your goal, we'll build your portfolio"
- Low minimums, fractional shares
- Educational content that doesn't patronize
- Integration with their existing banking app (bank-led model)

**Lifecycle focus:** Acquire → Activate (longest gap — may open account but never invest)

---

## Persona 2: The Self-Directed Trader

**Profile:** 30-55, financially literate, manages own portfolio. Has opinions about markets and enjoys active involvement.

**Goals:**
- Execute trades quickly and cheaply
- Access research, charts, and market data
- Manage a diversified portfolio across asset classes
- Tax-efficient investing

**Pain Points:**
- Slow or unreliable execution
- Limited research tools compared to dedicated trading platforms
- Poor mobile experience for complex orders
- No consolidated view across accounts (taxable + retirement)

**Behavior:**
- Logs in frequently (daily or multiple times per week)
- Uses limit orders, stop losses, options
- Compares platforms aggressively on tools, data, and cost
- Will switch platforms for better execution or lower cost

**What wins them:**
- Fast, reliable trade execution
- Real-time data, charts, screeners
- Advanced order types
- Consolidated multi-account view with tax optimization

**Lifecycle focus:** Activate → Expand (add account types, asset classes, trading tools)

---

## Persona 3: The Set-and-Forget Investor

**Profile:** 35-55, busy professional or dual-income household. Wants to build wealth but doesn't want to think about it daily.

**Goals:**
- Automated investing aligned with long-term goals (retirement, education, house)
- Minimal time spent managing investments
- Confidence that someone/something competent is handling it
- Reasonable fees for the convenience

**Pain Points:**
- Doesn't have time to research and pick stocks
- Worried about market timing — wants to dollar-cost average
- Unsure if current allocation is still right for their life stage
- Gets anxious during market downturns with no guidance

**Behavior:**
- Sets up recurring monthly investment and checks quarterly
- Values robo-advisory or target-date funds
- Engages more during major life events (baby, job change, inheritance)
- Responsive to proactive communication during volatility

**What wins them:**
- Robo-advisory with goal tracking
- Automatic rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting
- "Here's what we did for you this quarter" reporting
- Calm, contextual communication during market events

**Lifecycle focus:** Activate → Retain (key risk: silent attrition — they forget about the account entirely)

---

## Persona 4: The Banking Cross-Over

**Profile:** Existing banking client (any age), holds deposits, maybe a mortgage or auto loan. Has never invested with the bank — money goes to Schwab, Fidelity, or sits in savings losing to inflation.

**Goals:**
- Start investing without the complexity of opening at a separate institution
- Keep everything in one place
- Grow savings beyond 0.5% interest rates
- Trust their bank/credit union with their investments

**Pain Points:**
- Didn't know the bank offered investing (awareness gap)
- Opening an investment account feels like starting from scratch (re-enter all info)
- No clear bridge from savings to investing ("How much should I move?")
- Worried about risk — savings feel "safe," investing feels "risky"

**Behavior:**
- Responds to contextual prompts in their banking app
- Starts small — moves $500-$5K from savings
- Values simplicity and trust over features
- Likely gravitates toward managed/robo rather than self-directed

**What wins them:**
- Seamless banking-to-investing experience (one login, pre-populated data)
- "Your savings earned $12 last year. Investing could have earned $X" messaging
- Low-risk starter options (money market funds, conservative portfolios)
- Single dashboard for banking + investing

**Lifecycle focus:** Acquire (banking → investing conversion is the critical journey)

---

## Persona 5: The Consolidator

**Profile:** 40-60, has accumulated investment accounts at multiple institutions over career/life changes. 401k from two former employers, IRA at Vanguard, taxable at Schwab, savings at their bank.

**Goals:**
- Simplify: bring everything under one roof
- Get a complete picture of their financial position
- Optimize for tax efficiency across accounts
- Prepare for retirement with a clear plan

**Pain Points:**
- ACAT transfers are painful and slow
- No single view across all accounts
- Each institution has different tools, logins, statements
- Tax implications of consolidation are unclear

**Behavior:**
- Moves deliberately — researches platform before consolidating
- High-value client (multiple accounts = significant AUM)
- Wants advisor access for the transition, self-service after
- Strong loyalty once consolidated — high retention

**What wins them:**
- Easy ACAT transfer flow with real-time tracking
- Aggregated view of all accounts (including external)
- Tax-aware consolidation recommendations
- Hybrid model: advisor for planning, digital for execution

**Lifecycle focus:** Expand → Retain (once consolidated, these are the stickiest clients)

---

## Persona 6: The Graduating Investor

**Profile:** Investor whose AUM has grown to $250K-$1M+. Self-directed is no longer sufficient — needs planning, tax strategy, estate considerations.

**Goals:**
- Access to a real advisor without losing self-service capabilities
- Financial planning beyond just investing (tax, estate, insurance)
- Confidence in a more complex portfolio
- Maintain control but with professional guidance

**Pain Points:**
- Current platform treats them the same as a $5K account
- No proactive outreach based on their growing complexity
- Can't easily transition from self-directed to advisory without switching platforms
- Competitors (private banks, RIAs) are actively recruiting them

**Behavior:**
- Wants hybrid: self-service for execution, advisor for strategy
- Values being recognized as a high-value client
- Responsive to proactive "your portfolio has grown — let's discuss planning" outreach
- This is the transition point from investing domain → wealth domain

**What wins them:**
- Proactive recognition: "Based on your AUM growth, you now qualify for advisory services"
- Seamless upgrade path — no new account opening, no re-paperwork
- Advisor workspace with full history of self-directed activity
- Tiered service model that feels earned, not sold

**Lifecycle focus:** Expand → Retain (or: transition to Wealth domain)
