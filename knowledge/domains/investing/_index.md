# Investing Domain

## Overview

Investing serves retail and mass-affluent clients with self-directed trading, robo-advisory, goal-based investing, and hybrid advisory services. This domain sits between retail banking and wealth management on the sophistication spectrum.

**Key distinction from Wealth Management:** Wealth is advisor-led, high-touch, HNWI-focused. Investing is digital-first, self-service, mass-market. As an investor's assets grow and needs become complex, they naturally graduate into the wealth domain — making investing the feeder pipeline for wealth.

## Two Entry Models

| Model | Description | Examples | Primary Challenge |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Pure Investing Provider** | Standalone brokerage or investing platform | Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, Robinhood, eToro, Interactive Brokers | Differentiating on experience, expanding to banking |
| **Bank-Led Investing** | Bank or credit union offering investing to existing retail clients | [Large CU], Chase Self-Directed, HSBC InvestDirect, DBS Vickers | Capturing investment wallet before it leaves to competitors |

Both models use the same journeys, products, and ROI levers — but the Acquire stage differs. Bank-led investing has the built-in advantage of an existing client relationship; pure investing providers must acquire from scratch.

## The Maturity Continuum

Investors evolve. The platform must support this journey:

```
Self-Directed → Robo-Advisory → Hybrid Advisory → Full Advisory (Wealth domain)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Investing Domain                                        Wealth Domain
(mass-market, digital-first, lower AUM)                 (HNWI, advisor-led, higher AUM)
```

**Transition triggers:** AUM threshold (typically $250K-$1M), life event complexity (estate planning, tax optimization), desire for personalized advice.

| Onboarding metrics | Medium | Industry studies + retail domain proxy | First engagement validates |
| Fee structures | Medium-High | Public data (SEC filings, fee schedules) | Client-specific data |
| Trading/activity metrics | Medium | Industry reports (Cerulli, JD Power) | First engagement validates |
| ROI levers | Low-Medium | Estimated from wealth + retail adjacent | First ROI model built |
