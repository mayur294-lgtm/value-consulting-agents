> **TEMPLATE COMPLIANCE NOTICE — READ BEFORE GENERATING**
>
> This template defines the MANDATORY structure of the Ignite Assess deliverable. ALL 7 sections must be present in the final report. No section may be omitted, summarized to a paragraph, or replaced with a placeholder.
>
> **Section 05 (Capability Assessment)** must contain the FULL capability assessment — the complete F/M/B heatmap, problem map, capability drill-downs, traceability matrix, path to target, and Data & AI readiness. This is NOT a summary referencing a separate document. It IS the document. Expect 200+ lines.

## 01. Level Setting — Our Understanding of [Client]'s Goals & Hurdles

### Strategic Objectives

[Group-level objectives synthesized from discovery workshops and assessment meetings. Frame as 3-5 strategic pillars the client has articulated.]

1. **[Objective 1]:** [Description — e.g., "Digital innovation with one unified experience across channels and lines of business"]
2. **[Objective 2]:** [Description — e.g., "Deepen customer relationships and keep value within the ecosystem"]
3. **[Objective 3]:** [Description — e.g., "Scale advisory capacity without proportional cost increase"]
4. **[Objective 4]:** [Description — e.g., "Data-driven decision making across operations"]

### The Opportunity

[Market sizing and growth potential. Frame what's at stake — the addressable market, the customer base potential, the revenue upside.]

| Segment | Current State | Potential |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| [Segment 1] | [Current metrics] | [Growth opportunity] |
| [Segment 2] | [Current metrics] | [Growth opportunity] |
| [Segment 3] | [Current metrics] | [Growth opportunity] |

### Financial Position in Context

*[Optional — include if Market Context Module 1 data is available]*

[Connect the client's published financial metrics to the opportunity. Show where they stand vs. peers and what the numbers mean for the transformation case.]

| Metric | [Client] | Peer Median | Best-in-Class | Gap | Provenance |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|-----|-----------|
| Cost-to-Income | [X]% | [Y]% | [Z]% | [+/- Xpp] | [Annual Report / Investor Deck] |
| Digital Adoption | [X]% | [Y]% | [Z]% | [-Xpp] | [Source] |
| [Domain-specific] | [X] | [Y] | [Z] | [Gap] | [Source] |

[Narrative connecting these metrics to the transformation opportunity. E.g., "The 8pp cost-to-income gap above the peer median represents approximately $[X]M in annual excess operating cost. Our assessment identified $[Y]M of this as addressable through digital channel shift and process automation."]

### Customer Life Moments

[Map customer life stages to banking needs and where the bank can capture value. Make this human and emotional — this is the "who are we doing this for" section.]

| Life Moment | Banking Need | Where [Client] Captures Value | Current State |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------------|---------------|
| [e.g., "Just started earning"] | [e.g., "First salary account, budgeting tools"] | [e.g., "Acquisition, daily banking"] | [e.g., "No digital-first onboarding for young segment"] |
| [e.g., "Building a family"] | [e.g., "Home loan, insurance, child savings plan"] | [e.g., "Cross-sell, deepen relationship"] | [e.g., "Products exist but no proactive advisory triggers"] |
| [e.g., "Children's education"] | [e.g., "Education savings, investment planning"] | [e.g., "AUM growth, advisory fees"] | [e.g., "No goal-based savings capability"] |
| [e.g., "Pre-retirement"] | [e.g., "Wealth consolidation, retirement income"] | [e.g., "Wealth retention, inter-generational transfer"] | [e.g., "Manual advisory, no digital wealth tools"] |

[Narrative: "Every life moment is an opportunity to deepen the relationship — or lose the customer to a competitor who meets them where they are."]

### The Catalyst — Why Now

[What is the trigger for change? Frame around market shifts, competitive pressure, regulatory change, or internal strategic mandate. This is the "why now" — make it urgent and compelling.]

### Competitive Landscape

*[Optional — include if Market Context Module 2 or Module 3 data is available]*

[Show what the market looks like from the outside-in. What are digital leaders doing? What do customers experience elsewhere?]

**What digital leaders in [country/region] are doing:**

| Competitor / Leader | What They Offer | Relevance to [Client] |
|--------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| [e.g., "GXS Bank"] | [e.g., "Instant account opening, <5 min onboarding with eKYC"] | [e.g., "Client's 7-day cycle is losing the young segment"] |
| [e.g., "DBS digibank"] | [e.g., "68% digital containment, AI-powered servicing"] | [e.g., "Client at 20% containment — 3x cost differential"] |

*[If CX data available:]* [Client] mobile app rating: [X]/5 vs. peer average [Y]/5. Top customer complaints: "[Z]".

*[If no competitor data available for domain:]* "Public competitive capability data is limited for [wealth/commercial] banking in [country]. However, regional trends from [source] indicate [relevant trend]."

### Key Challenges Faced Today

[Summarize 4-6 current challenges as headlines with brief descriptions. These come directly from discovery evidence. If financial metric correlations are available, connect challenges to top-line impact.]

| Challenge | Description | Business Impact | Financial Link |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **[Challenge 1]** | [e.g., "Group-wide digital fragmentation"] | [Impact — e.g., "Inconsistent CX, duplicated investment"] | [e.g., "Contributes to C/I gap of +8pp"] |
| **[Challenge 2]** | [e.g., "Manual operating model & constrained capacity"] | [Impact] | [Financial link if available] |

| **[Challenge 4]** | [e.g., "Data trapped in silos"] | [Impact] | [Financial link if available] |

### The Legacy Trap

[Visualize the current architecture problem. Describe the siloed systems landscape that is blocking CX and productivity gains. Name the specific systems and integration pain points discovered.]

**Current State Architecture (Simplified):**

| Layer | What Exists Today | Pain |
|-------|-------------------|------|
| **Customer Channels** | [List: mobile app, internet banking, branch, etc.] | [Fragmented, inconsistent] |
| **Employee Tools** | [List: CRM, back-office, manual systems] | [Context switching, no 360 view] |
| **Integration** | [List: point-to-point, batch files, manual handoffs] | [No orchestration, brittle] |
| **Core Systems** | [List: core banking, payments, etc.] | [Legacy, limited API exposure] |

### The Cost of Standing Still

[Quantify what happens if the organization does nothing. This bridges Act 1 to Act 2 — creating urgency for the vision.]

| Inaction Consequence | Quantified Impact | Timeframe |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| [e.g., "Continued customer attrition to digital-first competitors"] | [e.g., "$[X]M revenue at risk annually"] | [e.g., "Already happening"] |
| [e.g., "Rising cost-to-serve as manual processes scale linearly"] | [e.g., "$[X]M additional cost over 3 years"] | [e.g., "Accelerating"] |
| [e.g., "Regulatory non-compliance risk"] | [e.g., "Fines, license risk"] | [e.g., "[Date/deadline]"] |

# SECTION 2: The Vision

---

## 02. The Unified Banking Platform — Long-Term Transformation

### [Client] Tomorrow

[Describe the target state vision. Use the "unified frontline" narrative: one intelligent frontline that runs end-to-end servicing and sales journeys across all segments, replacing today's multiple customer and staff apps.]

**Key principles:**
- **Journey-based:** Organize around customer journeys, not products or channels
- **Front-to-back:** Every journey orchestrated end-to-end (experience → capability → integration)
- **Incremental:** Progressive modernization, not big-bang replacement
- **Platform-first:** Build once, reuse across segments and journeys

### Progressive Modernization Approach

[Describe the phased approach to transformation. Frame as progressive modernization — each phase builds on the previous.]

| Phase | Focus | Outcome |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Set the Foundation** | Unified platform, core journeys | Modern front-end, orchestration layer |
| **Build Differentiation** | Advanced journeys, intelligence | Data-driven engagement, automation |
| **Accelerate Growth** | AI, agentic workflows, ecosystem | Self-optimizing, proactive banking |

### [Client]'s Journey — Progressive Modernization

[Map phases across lines of business. Show which LoB starts first (the lighthouse) and how the platform is reused.]

| | Phase 1 (Lighthouse) | Phase 2 | Phase 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[LoB 1 — e.g., Wealth]** | MVP: Core journeys | Advanced advisory | AI-native |
| **[LoB 2 — e.g., Retail]** | — | Onboarding + servicing | Full digital banking |
| **[LoB 3 — e.g., SME]** | — | — | Extend platform |

| F1 | [e.g., "Manual document exchange via email"] | [Stage 3] | [RM, Customer] | [e.g., "Delays, repeated requests"] | [e.g., "40 min per application chasing docs"] | [E-IDs] |
| F2 | [Friction] | [Stage] | [Actor] | [Impact] | [Impact] | [E-IDs] |

**Total end-to-end time:** [X days/hours]
**Manual handoffs:** [Count]
**Systems involved:** [Count]
**RM time per case:** [X hours]
**Back-office time per case:** [X hours]

#### Business Benefits

[Quantified benefits from improving this journey. Show the math transparently.]

**Total Annual Benefits: $[X]-[Y]**

| Benefit Category | Annual Impact | Basis |
|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| **Revenue uplift** | $[X] | [Calculation — e.g., "+X% conversion × Y prospects × $Z LTV"] |
| **Cost avoidance** | $[X] | [Calculation — e.g., "X hrs saved × Y cases × $Z/hr"] |
| **Total** | **$[X]** | |

**How Benefits Are Calculated:**

| Metric | Current | Target | Delta | Annual Value |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|-------------|
| [e.g., "Onboarding cycle time"] | [Baseline] | [Target] | [Delta] | [$ impact] |
| [e.g., "RM time per case"] | [Baseline] | [Target] | [Delta] | [$ impact] |
| [e.g., "Completion rate"] | [Baseline] | [Target] | [Delta] | [$ impact] |

#### Proposed Solution

[Describe the to-be state. What changes, what technology enables it, what the user experience looks like for both customer and employee.]

**What good looks like:**
[Reference 1-2 external examples of banks/fintechs that have achieved this. Use market context research if available, otherwise use domain knowledge. These examples make the solution tangible — not hypothetical.]

> *[e.g., "DBS processes 90% of retail account openings digitally in under 10 minutes. Monzo onboards in <5 minutes with real-time eKYC. This is the standard [Client]'s customers now benchmark against."]*

**Backbase solution components:**

| Component | Backbase Product | What It Does | OOTB / Extend |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| [e.g., "Journey Orchestration"] | [e.g., "Onboarding Orchestrator"] | [e.g., "End-to-end process automation with STP rules"] | [OOTB] |
| [e.g., "Identity Verification"] | [e.g., "eIDV Integration"] | [e.g., "Automated document capture + liveness check"] | [Extend] |
| [e.g., "Exception Handling"] | [e.g., "Case Manager"] | [e.g., "Staff handle only exceptions with full context"] | [OOTB] |

**Target outcomes:**
- End-to-end time: [X days] → [Y hours]
- Completion rate: [X]% → [Y]%
- STP rate: [X]% → [Y]%
- RM time per case: [X hrs] → [Y hrs]

## 08. Application Architecture

### Current State (As-Is)

[Describe the current technology landscape. List systems, integration patterns, and architectural pain points.]

| Layer | Systems | Integration | Pain Points |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Channels** | [List] | [e.g., "Siloed per channel"] | [e.g., "No shared state"] |
| **Orchestration** | [List or "None"] | [e.g., "Point-to-point"] | [e.g., "No BPM, manual handoffs"] |
| **Core Systems** | [List] | [e.g., "Batch, limited API"] | [e.g., "Legacy, slow change cycles"] |

### Proposed State (To-Be)

[Describe the target architecture with Backbase platform positioned. Show the orchestration layer, integration approach, and progressive modernization path.]

| Layer | Proposed | Integration | Benefit |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Unified Frontline** | [Backbase web/mobile apps, employee portal] | [Unified UX layer] | [Consistent CX, single codebase] |
| **Orchestration** | [Backbase platform + BPM engine] | [API-first, event-driven] | [End-to-end journeys, STP] |
| **Integration** | [Integration layer / API gateway] | [REST APIs, real-time] | [Decoupled, scalable] |
| **Core Systems** | [Existing — no change required] | [Wrapped with APIs] | [Protect investment, progressive] |

### Architecture Transformation Journey

[Visual concept showing the progressive modernization path from as-is to to-be. This should be rendered as a visual diagram in the presentation — showing how the architecture evolves across phases, with the Backbase platform progressively wrapping existing systems.]

**Phase 1 (Foundation):** Backbase orchestration layer sits on top of existing core → wraps legacy with APIs → enables digital journeys without replacing core

**Phase 2 (Differentiation):** Intelligence layer added → data foundation feeds analytics → proactive engagement capabilities enabled

**Phase 3 (Acceleration):** AI/agentic layer → self-optimizing journeys → predictive servicing → human-in-the-loop for exceptions only

*[NOTE FOR PRESENTATION RENDERING: This section should be visualized as a layered architecture diagram with progressive phase overlays — showing the "before" state as siloed blocks, and the "after" state as a unified platform with orchestration layer. Use the presentation skill's architecture scene type.]*

*[NARRATIVE BRIDGE: "The journey assessments above reveal specific friction points in how [Client] serves its customers. But these frictions are symptoms of deeper capability gaps. The following section maps the bank's front-to-back capability maturity — showing exactly where the architectural weaknesses lie and what level of capability is needed to deliver the journeys described above."]*

# SECTION 5: Capability Assessment

---

## 09. Front-to-Back Capability Heatmap

### Assessment Methodology

**Scale:** 0-4 Maturity (Absent → Fragmented → Defined → Orchestrated → Intelligent)
**Structure:** Every capability assessed across Front Layer (Experience) / Middle Layer (Capability/Orchestration) / Back Layer (Integration + Systems of Record)
**Scoring Rule:** Overall score = weakest layer. The chain breaks at the weakest link.
**Bias:** Conservative. Score what exists, not what's planned.

### Problem Map

**Considered Needs** (What [Client] Already Knows):

| # | Problem | Severity | Impact | Evidence | Related Capabilities |
|---|---------|----------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| CN-01 | [Problem] | [Critical/High/Medium/Low] | [Quantified impact] | [E-IDs] | [CAP-IDs] |

**Unconsidered Needs** (What We Surfaced):

| 2 | [Driver] | $[X] | [Type] | [Confidence] |
| **Total** | | **$[X]** | | |

### Progressive Value Realization

[Show how value accumulates over time — the "value staircase." This makes the investment trajectory tangible: when does each value driver kick in, when does payback occur, and how does value compound.]

| Phase | Timeline | Value Drivers Active | Cumulative Benefits | Cumulative Investment | Net Position |
|-------|----------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Foundation** | [Months 0-6] | None (building) | $0 | $[X]M | -$[X]M |

| **Scale** | [Months 13-18] | [e.g., "+ Channel shift, + RM productivity"] | $[X]M | $[Y]M | [+/-]$[Z]M |
| **Payback** | [Month X] | All Phase 1 drivers active | $[X]M | $[Y]M | **$0 (breakeven)** |
| **Full Value** | [Year 3+] | All drivers at steady-state + compound growth | $[X]M | $[Y]M | +$[Z]M |

*[NOTE FOR PRESENTATION RENDERING: This should be visualized as an S-curve or value staircase chart — investment line vs. cumulative benefits line, with the crossover point (payback) highlighted. Each phase annotated with which value drivers activate.]*

### Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | ROI | NPV | Key Assumptions |
|----------|-----|-----|----------------|
| **Conservative** | [X]% | $[Y] | [Lower adoption, longer timeline] |

| Published Metric | Current | Projected Post-Transformation | Improvement | Basis |
|-----------------|---------|------------------------------|-------------|-------|
| Cost-to-Income Ratio | [X]% | [Y]% | [-Zpp] | [e.g., "$5.8M servicing cost reduction = ~1.5pp C/I improvement"] |
| Digital Adoption | [X]% | [Y]% | [+Zpp] | [e.g., "Channel shift from 20% to 55% digital containment"] |
| [Domain metric] | [X] | [Y] | [Delta] | [Basis] |

[Narrative: "The $[X]M in projected benefits translates to measurable improvement in [Client]'s published financial metrics — moving the cost-to-income ratio [X]pp closer to the peer median and increasing digital adoption by [Y]pp."]
