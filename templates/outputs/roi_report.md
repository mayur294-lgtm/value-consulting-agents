## Benefit Model Detail

### Benefit Stream 1: [Name, e.g., "Reduced Customer Support Costs"]

**Type:** Cost Savings

**Description:** [Clear explanation of the benefit]

**Baseline State:**
- Current support ticket volume: [X] per month
- Cost per ticket: $[Y] (includes labor, tools, overhead)
- Annual baseline cost: $[Z]

**Target State:**
- Expected ticket reduction: [X]% via [mechanism, e.g., self-service portal]
- New ticket volume: [X] per month
- Annual cost after initiative: $[Y]

**Benefit Calculation:**
```
Annual Savings = (Baseline Tickets - New Tickets) × Cost per Ticket
Annual Savings = ([X] - [Y]) × $[Z] = $[Total]
```

**Realization Timeline:**
- Months 0-6: 0% (implementation phase)
- Months 7-12: 50% (ramp-up)
- Months 13+: 100% (full realization)

**Confidence Level:** [High / Medium / Low]

**Rationale:** [Why this confidence level - based on data quality, precedent, risk]

**Measurement Approach:**
- **Metric:** Monthly support ticket volume by channel
- **Data Source:** Support ticketing system
- **Frequency:** Monthly
- **Owner:** Customer Support Manager

**Key Assumptions:**
- Assumption 1: [e.g., Self-service adoption rate of 30%]
- Assumption 2: [e.g., Cost per ticket remains constant]

### Benefit Stream 2: [Name]

**Type:** [Revenue / Cost Savings / Risk Mitigation / Efficiency]

[Repeat structure above for each benefit stream]

### Benefit Stream 3: [Name]

[Continue for all major benefit streams]

| 2 | Self-service adoption rate | 30% | Vendor case study | High | Low | Pilot test in Q1 |
| 3 | Implementation timeline | 6 months | Internal PMO historical data | Medium | High | Vendor confirmation |
| 4 | Annual ticket growth | 5% | Historical trend | Low | High | Finance team data |
| 5 | Discount rate | 10% | Company WACC | Medium | High | CFO standard |

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Scenario Modeling

| Scenario | Key Variables | NPV | Payback | IRR | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|-----|---------|-----|----------------|
| **Best Case** | Benefits +25%, Costs -15%, Timeline -10% | $[X] | [Y] mo | [Z]% | Strong Go |
| **Likely Case** | Base assumptions | $[X] | [Y] mo | [Z]% | Go |
| **Worst Case** | Benefits -25%, Costs +25%, Timeline +50% | $[X] | [Y] mo | [Z]% | Conditional Go |

### Key Variable Sensitivity

Impact of changing key assumptions:

**Benefit Realization:**
- If benefits achieve only 75% of target: NPV = $[X], Payback = [Y] months
- If benefits achieve 100% of target: NPV = $[X], Payback = [Y] months
- If benefits achieve 125% of target: NPV = $[X], Payback = [Y] months

**Implementation Cost:**
- If costs are 15% under budget: NPV = $[X], Payback = [Y] months
- If costs are on budget: NPV = $[X], Payback = [Y] months
- If costs are 25% over budget: NPV = $[X], Payback = [Y] months

**Timeline:**
- If implementation takes 6 months: NPV = $[X], Payback = [Y] months
- If implementation takes 9 months: NPV = $[X], Payback = [Y] months
- If implementation takes 12 months: NPV = $[X], Payback = [Y] months

### Tornado Chart (Conceptual)

[Most impactful variables ranked by sensitivity]

1. [Variable with highest impact on NPV]
2. [Second highest impact]
3. [Third highest impact]
