## Assessment Scope & Methodology

### Scope

**Capability Domains Assessed:**
- [Domain 1, e.g., Customer Experience]
- [Domain 2, e.g., Operational Excellence]
- [Domain 3, e.g., Technology Platform]

**Assessment Approach:**
- Stakeholder interviews: [X interviews with roles]
- Documentation review: [Systems reviewed]
- Data analysis: [Metrics analyzed]
- Industry benchmarking: [Sources used]

### Maturity Model

**Maturity Levels:**

- **Level 1 - Initial/Ad Hoc:** Processes are reactive, unpredictable; success depends on individuals; no standardization
- **Level 2 - Developing:** Basic processes defined; some repeatability; limited tooling; inconsistent execution
- **Level 3 - Defined:** Standardized processes organization-wide; clear roles; adequate tooling; consistent execution
- **Level 4 - Managed:** Processes measured and controlled; data-driven decisions; integrated tooling; continuous improvement
- **Level 5 - Optimizing:** Proactive optimization; innovation and experimentation; automated insights; industry-leading

**Scoring Approach:**
- Evidence-based scoring using interview data, metrics, and observations
- Conservative bias when data is limited
- Context-aware targets based on business strategy
- Focus on outcomes, not just process existence

**Maturity Scoring Rationale:**

[Explain why this specific score was assigned, referencing maturity criteria:]
- Scored [X] because [evidence against maturity level definition]
- Did not score higher because [what's missing for next level]
- Target of [Y] is appropriate because [business justification]

**Dependencies:**

- **Depends on:** [Other capabilities that must exist first]
- **Enables:** [What this capability unlocks]

**Improvement Path:**
