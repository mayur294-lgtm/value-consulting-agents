## Appendices

### Appendix A: Assessment Methodology

**Maturity Model:** BIAN-aligned 0-4 scale (Absent → Fragmented → Defined → Orchestrated → Intelligent)

**Assessment Structure:** Each capability assessed across three architectural layers:
- **Front Layer** (Experience Plane): Customer/employee-facing interfaces
- **Middle Layer** (Capability Plane): Orchestration, business logic, decisioning
- **Back Layer** (Integration Plane + Systems of Record): Connectivity, data, core systems

**Scoring Approach:**
- Evidence-based using probing questions from capability taxonomy
- Conservative bias when data is limited
- Overall score = weakest layer (the chain breaks at the weakest link)
- Problem-first: capabilities are assessed in context of business problems they solve

**Reference:** `knowledge/standards/capability_taxonomy.md`
