## Data Quality Expectations

### What Makes Good Input Data

**Clear:**
- Unambiguous statements
- Specific examples and details
- Quantified where possible

**Recent:**
- Current state data from last 3-6 months
- Reflects present reality, not aspirational future

**Validated:**
- Comes from authoritative sources
- Cross-referenced where possible
- Known accuracy and completeness

### Handling Incomplete Data

When data is missing or incomplete:
1. Document the gap explicitly
2. Make conservative assumptions where necessary
3. Flag for validation
4. Proceed with documented limitations

## Input Formats

**Accepted Formats:**
- Text transcripts (.txt, .docx, .md)
- Spreadsheets (.xlsx, .csv)
- PDF documents
- Presentations (.pptx, .pdf)
- System exports (CSVs, reports)

**Structured Data Preferred:**
- Tabular data for metrics and financials
- Clearly labeled and organized
- Source and date documented

## Minimum Viable Discovery

At minimum, discovery requires:
1. **Business context** (industry, strategy, goals)
2. **3+ stakeholder interviews** (covering business and technical perspectives)
3. **Pain points** with business impact
4. **Current state costs** (at least estimated)
5. **Constraints** (budget, timeline, requirements)

If these are unavailable, engagement cannot proceed without documented assumptions and client acceptance of limitations.
