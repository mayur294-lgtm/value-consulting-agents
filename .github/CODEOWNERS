# Value Consulting AgenticOS — Code Owners
#
# Two contribution tiers:
#   ARCHITECTS (Mayur, Shobhit) — can modify anything
#   CONSULTANTS (everyone else) — can only contribute to knowledge/ and benchmarks/
#
# CODEOWNERS controls who gets auto-requested for review.
# The enforce-contribution-scope.yml workflow enforces path restrictions.

# ─── DEFAULT: Architects own everything ───

# ─── KNOWLEDGE: Consultants can contribute learnings ───
# These paths are open for consultant contributions (knowledge harvest,
# benchmark corrections, domain expansions). Architects still review.
