# SLIDE 1: Executive Decision Request

## What We're Asking You to Decide

**Approve $8M investment over 18 months to transform digital onboarding and self-service capabilities**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Investment | **$8.0M** |
| Annual Benefits (Year 3+) | **$8.2M** |
| Net Present Value | **$5.2M** |
| Payback Period | **18 months** |
| IRR | **42%** |

**Recommendation: CONDITIONAL GO**

*Conditional on validating baseline data in Phase 0 (Weeks 1-4)*

# SLIDE 2: The Business Problem

## Three Critical Pain Points from Discovery

### 1. Onboarding is Broken
> *"Our onboarding completion rate is low. A lot of customers drop off when documents are required."*
> — Head of Retail

- Customers abandoning during document verification
- Cycle times exceed 7 days
- Digital onboarding "hasn't scaled well"

### 2. Servicing is Expensive
> *"Servicing is expensive. Simple requests still come through the call center."*
> — Operations Lead

- High-cost channels handling routine requests
- No visibility into customer channel behavior
- Manual workarounds consuming staff time

### 3. No Data to Optimize
> *"We don't have a clear view of why customers choose branch or call over digital."*
> — Operations Lead

- Cannot identify or fix friction points
- Decisions based on anecdotes, not data

# SLIDE 3: Cost of Inaction

## What Happens If We Do Nothing?

| Impact Area | 3-Year Cost |
|-------------|-------------|
| Lost customer acquisition (30K customers/year not converted) | **$6M+** |
| Continued servicing inefficiency ($4M/year excess cost) | **$12M+** |
| Competitive disadvantage vs. digital-first banks | **Market share erosion** |
| Strategic risk - cannot execute digital strategy | **Future growth constrained** |

### Total Cost of Inaction: **$18M+ over 3 years**

*Status quo is not sustainable in a digital-first market*

# SLIDE 8: Scenario Analysis

## What If Things Go Better or Worse?

| Scenario | NPV | Payback | IRR | Verdict |
|----------|-----|---------|-----|---------|
| **Best Case** (+25% benefits, -15% costs) | $9.8M | 12 mo | 68% | Strong Go |
| **Likely Case** (base assumptions) | $5.2M | 18 mo | 42% | Conditional Go |
| **Worst Case** (-25% benefits, +25% costs) | $0.8M | 36 mo | 12% | Still Positive |

### Key Insight

**Even in worst case, this initiative is NPV positive.**

Downside risk is contained. Upside potential is significant.

# SLIDE 9: Sensitivity - What Moves the Needle?

## Top 3 Variables That Drive ROI

```
                     NPV IMPACT (±25% change in variable)
                     ─────────────────────────────────────
                     -$3M  -$2M  -$1M   $0   +$1M  +$2M  +$3M
                       │     │     │     │     │     │     │
1. Digital            ◄═══════════════════════════════════►
   Containment Rate          HIGHEST LEVERAGE
   (±10pp = ±$2.5M NPV)

2. Transaction Cost   ◄════════════════════════════►
   by Channel
   (±$2/txn = ±$2.0M NPV)

3. Onboarding         ◄══════════════════►
   Completion Rate
   (±10pp = ±$1.3M NPV)
```

**Recommendation:** Validate these 3 variables first in Phase 0.

# SLIDE 10: Key Assumptions

## What We Don't Know Yet

### Critical Assumptions Requiring Validation

| Assumption | Current Estimate | NPV Impact if Wrong | Validation |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Onboarding completion rate | 40% | ±$1.3M | Extract from CRM (Week 1-2) |
| Transaction cost by channel | $10 call, $1 digital | ±$2.0M | Finance analysis (Week 2-3) |
| Monthly transaction volume | 100,000 | ±$1.5M | Operations data (Week 1-2) |
| Digital containment rate | 20% | ±$2.5M | Channel logs (Week 1-2) |

### Phase 0 Deliverable

**Validated baseline data by Week 4** → Confirm or adjust business case

# SLIDE 12: Key Risks & Mitigations

## What Could Go Wrong?

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Baseline data invalidates case** | Benefits reduced 30-50% | Medium | Validate in Phase 0 before major spend |
| **Regulatory delays (eKYC)** | 6-month delay | Medium | Early engagement, compliant vendor |
| **Low digital adoption** | 40% benefit reduction | Medium | Change management, incentives, pilot |
| **Integration complexity** | $2M overrun | Medium | API-first design, vendor expertise |

### Risk-Adjusted NPV: $4.0M (still strongly positive)

**15% contingency ($1M) built into cost estimate**

# SLIDE 14: Success Metrics

## How We'll Measure Progress

### Financial Success
- [ ] Achieve ≥80% of modeled NPV ($4M+)
- [ ] Break even by Month 18
- [ ] Stay within ±10% of budget

### Business Success
| Metric | Current | Target | By When |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| Onboarding completion | 40%* | 65% | Month 18 |
| Digital containment | 20%* | 50% | Month 18 |
| Onboarding cycle time | 7+ days | <2 days | Month 12 |

*Assumed - to be validated in Phase 0

### Execution Success
- [ ] Pilot launch on time (Month 6)
- [ ] Full rollout by Month 15
- [ ] All priority features delivered

---

# SLIDE 15: Recommendation

## Conditional Go

### Why Go?

- ✅ Strong ROI: NPV $5.2M, 42% IRR, 18-month payback
- ✅ Even worst case is NPV positive ($0.8M)
- ✅ Addresses validated business pain (E1-E8)
- ✅ Competitive necessity in digital-first market
- ✅ Cost of inaction exceeds investment required

### Why Conditional?

- ⚠️ Key baseline data not yet validated
- ⚠️ Regulatory path for eKYC needs confirmation
- ⚠️ Phase 0 validation limits risk to $1.5M if case weakens

### The Ask

**Approve Phase 0 ($1.5M) immediately**

Full approval after baseline validation (Month 3)

---

# SLIDE 16: Next Steps

|--------|-------|----------|
| Approve Phase 0 funding ($1.5M) | Executive Committee | Day 7 |

# APPENDIX A: Evidence Summary

## What We Heard from Stakeholders

| ID | Quote | Source | Pain Point |
|----|-------|--------|------------|
| E1 | "Our onboarding completion rate is low" | Head of Retail | Low conversion |
| E2 | "Customers drop off when documents are required" | Head of Retail | Document friction |
| E3 | "Can take more than a week in some cases" | Head of Retail | Slow cycle time |
| E4 | "Servicing is expensive" | Operations Lead | High costs |
| E5 | "Simple requests still come through call center" | Operations Lead | Channel inefficiency |
| E6 | "No clear view of why customers choose branch or call over digital" | Operations Lead | No analytics |
| E7 | "Digital onboarding hasn't scaled well" | Digital Lead | Scaling issues |
| E8 | "Teams rely on manual workarounds" | Digital Lead | Process gaps |

# APPENDIX B: Benefit Calculations

## Benefit Stream 1: Onboarding (Revenue)

```
Current:  10,000 apps/month × 40% completion × 12 months × $200/customer = $9.6M
Target:   10,000 apps/month × 65% completion × 12 months × $200/customer = $15.6M
                                                                          ────────
Gross Improvement:                                                        $6.0M

Conservative adjustment (60% probability weight):                         $3.6M
Further conservatism (model uses):                                        $2.4M
```

## Benefit Stream 2: Channel Shift (Cost Savings)

```
Current:  80,000 high-cost txns/month × $10/txn × 12 = $9.6M cost
Target:   40,000 high-cost txns/month × $10/txn × 12 = $4.8M cost
                                                       ────────
Gross Savings:                                         $4.8M

Add volume growth + optimization:                      $5.8M (modeled)
```

# APPENDIX C: Assumptions Register (Summary)

## Critical Assumptions

| # | Assumption | Value | Confidence | Validation |
|---|------------|-------|------------|------------|
| A1 | Current completion rate | 40% | Low | DG1 - CRM data |
| A2 | Cost per call/branch transaction | $10 | Medium | DG5 - Finance |
| A3 | Monthly application volume | 10,000 | Low | DG4 - CRM data |
| A4 | Current digital containment | 20% | Low | DG6 - Operations |

**All critical assumptions flagged for Phase 0 validation.**

If baseline data materially different, business case will be updated before Phase 1 approval.

# APPENDIX D: Alternatives Considered

| Option | NPV | Payback | Why Not Selected |
|--------|-----|---------|------------------|
| A. Onboarding only | $2.8M | 16 mo | Misses $5.8M channel shift opportunity |
