### P2: Extended Onboarding Cycle Times
**Evidence:** E3
**Lifecycle Stage:** Activate
**Business Impact:** Poor time-to-value, customer satisfaction risk, operational inefficiency

**Quantification:** 7+ days in some cases (no average provided)

**Consequence:**
- Customer frustration and potential abandonment
- Delayed revenue recognition

## Business Context Summary

**Domain:** Retail Banking
**Region:** South East Asia (Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam - context dependent)
**Primary Journeys:** Onboarding, Servicing
**Strategic Situation:** Bank has invested in digital capabilities but adoption and scaling are below expectations

**Key Stakeholder Perspectives:**

## Assumptions Made During Discovery

| Assumption ID | Assumption | Rationale | Confidence | Validation Needed |
|---------------|------------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| A1 | "Low" completion rate means <60% | Industry context for retail banking | Low | Validate with client data |
| A2 | "Expensive" servicing means cost-to-serve >$15 per transaction | Regional banking benchmarks | Low | Validate with finance team |
| A3 | Bank operates in multiple SEA markets | "SEA Region" in intake | Medium | Confirm market footprint |
| A4 | Digital onboarding launched within last 12-24 months | Recent enough to be "scaling issue" vs. legacy | Low | Confirm launch timeline |
| A5 | No major regulatory blockers to digital enhancement | Standard SEA banking environment | Medium | Validate compliance requirements |

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Validation Actions (Next 7 Days)
1. **DG1-DG7:** Request client data for all high-priority gaps
2. **A1-A2:** Clarify quantitative definitions of "low" and "expensive"
3. **Market Context:** Confirm which SEA markets are in scope

### Analysis Approach Given Data Gaps
Since critical quantitative data is unavailable, the assessment will:
1. Use MEDIUM-confidence global benchmarks as proxies (labeled as such)
2. Model benefit scenarios with conservative assumptions
3. Flag all assumptions explicitly in ROI model
4. Recommend data gathering as Phase 0 initiative
