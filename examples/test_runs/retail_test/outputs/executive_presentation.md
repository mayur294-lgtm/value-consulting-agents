**Client:** Retail Bank - SEA Region
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Prepared by:** Value Consulting Team

---

## Slide 1: Title & Decision Request

### Digital Banking Transformation Investment Proposal

**Decision Requested:**
Approve $8.0M investment over 18 months to transform digital onboarding and servicing capabilities.

**Expected Return:**
$8.2M in annual recurring benefits, achieving payback in 18 months with NPV of $5.2M.

**Recommendation:**
**CONDITIONAL GO** - Proceed with phased approach contingent on validation of baseline assumptions in Phase 0 (Months 0-3).

---

## Slide 2: The Ask (Upfront)

### What We Need You to Decide Today

**Primary Decision:**
Approve Conditional Go and authorize Phase 0 funding ($1.5M) for data validation and planning.

**Conditions for Full Approval:**
1. Validate baseline metrics (completion rate, transaction costs, volumes) - Weeks 1-4
2. Secure regulatory clearance for eKYC approach - Weeks 1-8
3. Confirm pilot shows minimum 10pp completion and 20pp containment improvement - Month 9

**Key Actions Required:**
- Appoint Executive Sponsor (C-level with P&L accountability) - Week 1
- Allocate Phase 0 budget ($1.5M) - Week 1
- Commit to 3-phase approach with decision gates at Months 3, 9, 15

**Timeline for Final Decision:**
Month 3 - Present refined business case with validated data for full investment approval.

---

## Slide 3: Situation - The Business Problem

### We Are Losing Customers and Burning Cash

**Three Critical Business Challenges:**

**1. Customer Acquisition is Constrained**
- Onboarding completion rate is low (40% estimated vs. 65% industry benchmark)
- Customers drop off when documents are required
- Cycle times exceed 7 days vs. <48 hours at digital leaders
- **Impact:** Losing 30,000 customers annually = $6M+ first-year revenue

**2. Servicing Costs Are High**
- Servicing is expensive - simple requests routed to $10 call center vs. $1 digital
- Digital containment estimated at 20% vs. 60% industry benchmark
- No visibility into why customers choose expensive channels
- **Impact:** $4-5M annual cost inefficiency; cannot scale

**3. No Data-Driven Optimization**
- No journey tracking or customer behavior analytics
- Cannot measure drop-off points or channel performance
- Decision-making based on anecdotes, not data
- **Impact:** Cannot improve systematically; flying blind

---

## Slide 4: Cost of Inaction

### What Happens If We Do Nothing?

**Financial Impact Over 3 Years:**

| Impact Area | Annual Cost | 3-Year Total |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Lost customer acquisition | $6M | $18M |
| Continued servicing inefficiency | $4-5M | $12-15M |
| **Total Cost of Inaction** | **$10-11M** | **$30-33M** |

**Strategic Consequences:**

**Competitive Disadvantage Accelerates**
- Digital-first banks (GXS, Trust Bank, Aspirasi) and regional leaders (DBS, CIMB digital) continue raising customer experience bar
- Bank unable to compete for digitally-savvy customers
- Relegated to traditional bank serving aging customer base

**Cannot Pursue Future Innovation**
- No foundation for AI, personalization, open banking, embedded finance
- Becomes technology laggard unable to innovate
- Strategic dead end

**Employee Impact**
- Continued manual workarounds drive frustration and talent loss
- Best employees leave for digital-first competitors

**The Question Is Not Whether to Transform - It's How Fast We Can Move**

---

## Slide 5: What We Assessed

### Comprehensive Digital Capability Assessment

**Assessment Scope:**

**Capabilities Evaluated:**
- Customer Acquisition (onboarding, identity verification, application processing)
- Customer Servicing (self-service, channel orchestration, service requests)
- Data & Analytics (journey analytics, channel behavior, dashboards)
- Operational Excellence (automation, workflow, change management)

**Evidence Sources:**
- Stakeholder interviews with Head of Retail, Operations Lead, Digital Lead
- Current state observation and documentation review
- Industry benchmarking (global and regional)
- Data gap analysis

**Assessment Period:** 2026-01-13

**Methodology:** Evidence-based maturity scoring (1-5 scale) with conservative bias

---

## Slide 6: Key Findings - Current State

### Overall Maturity: 2.2 / 5.0 (Developing - Level 2)

**What This Means:**
- Digital capabilities exist but execution is inconsistent
- Heavy reliance on manual workarounds
- Success depends on individual heroics, not systematic processes
- 0.8 points below global average (3.0)
- 1.8 points behind regional leaders (4.0+)
- **Translation: 12-24 months behind competition**

**Critical Gaps Identified:**

| Capability | Current | Target | Gap | Business Impact |
|------------|---------|--------|-----|-----------------|
| Digital Onboarding Journey | 1.5 | 3.5 | 2.0 | $2.4M revenue opportunity |
| Digital Self-Service | 1.5 | 3.5 | 2.0 | $5.8M cost savings |
| Journey Analytics | 1.0 | 3.0 | 2.0 | Enables optimization |
| Workflow Orchestration | 1.5 | 3.5 | 2.0 | Foundation for automation |

**Key Insight:** Gaps are significant but addressable - closing to industry average yields $8M+ annual benefits.

## Slide 7: Finding 1 - Digital Onboarding Not Delivering

### Launched But Not Scaled

**Current Performance:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Onboarding Funnel (Current State)   │
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Start Application     100%  (10,000) │
│ ↓ (-20%)                             │
│ Complete Profile      80%   (8,000)  │
│ ↓ (-25%) ← FRICTION POINT           │
│ Submit Documents      60%   (6,000)  │
│ ↓ (-20%)                             │
│ Complete Onboarding   40%   (4,000)  │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘

Lost: 6,000 customers per month
     72,000 customers per year
```

**Root Causes:**
- Document verification is manual and slow (7+ day cycle time)
- No workflow automation - teams use workarounds
- No straight-through processing - all applications follow same path
- Fragmented systems with manual handoffs

**Evidence:**
- "Our onboarding completion rate is low" (Head of Retail)
- "Customers drop off when documents are required" (Head of Retail)
- "It can take more than a week in some cases" (Head of Retail)
- "Digital onboarding hasn't scaled well" (Digital Lead)
- "Teams still rely on manual workarounds" (Digital Lead)

**Business Impact:**
Losing 30,000 additional customers annually vs. 65% industry benchmark completion = $6M first-year revenue opportunity + lifetime value

---

## Slide 8: Finding 2 - Servicing Costs Unscalable

### Simple Transactions Routed to Expensive Channels

**Current Channel Mix:**
```
Monthly Transactions: 100,000

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Channel Distribution (Current)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Digital (20%)      █████  20,000 @ $1   │
│ Call Center (50%)  ████████████  50,000 │
│                              @ $10       │
│ Branch (30%)       ████████  30,000     │
│                              @ $15       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Monthly Cost: $820K
Annual Cost: $9.8M
```

**Target Channel Mix (60% Digital):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Channel Distribution (Target)           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Digital (60%)      ████████████████      │
│                    60,000 @ $1          │
│ Call Center (25%)  ██████  25,000 @ $10 │
│ Branch (15%)       ████  15,000 @ $15   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Monthly Cost: $535K (35% reduction)
Annual Cost: $6.4M
Annual Savings: $3.4M (conservative)
```

**Root Causes:**
- Limited self-service functionality (only basic transactions available)
- Poor customer awareness and usability
- No proactive channel deflection
- No analytics to understand channel behavior

**Evidence:**
- "Servicing is expensive" (Operations Lead)
- "Simple requests still come through the call center" (Operations Lead)
- "We don't have a clear view of why customers choose branch or call over digital" (Operations Lead)

---

## Slide 10: Benefit Breakdown - Where Value Comes From

### Two Primary Benefit Streams

**Benefit Composition (Steady State):**

```
Total Annual Benefits: $8.2M

┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Revenue Growth (29%)          $2.4M      │
│ ████████████                              │
│                                           │
│ Cost Reduction (71%)          $5.8M      │
│ █████████████████████████████             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**1. Revenue Growth - Customer Acquisition ($2.4M/year)**
- Improve onboarding completion from 40% → 65%
- Acquire 30,000 additional customers annually
- $200 average first-year revenue per customer
- Conservative: 60% probability-weighted

**2. Cost Reduction - Channel Shift ($5.8M/year)**
- Shift 40,000 monthly transactions to digital
- Improve digital containment from 20% → 60%
- $9 cost differential per transaction shifted
- Conservative: Modeled at 50% containment vs. 60% target

**Realization Timeline:**
- Year 1: $3.1M (40% realization - pilot + phased rollout)
- Year 2: $6.7M (85% realization - full deployment)
- Year 3+: $8.2M (100% steady state)

**Additional Upside (Not Modeled):**
- Improved customer lifetime value through better experience
- Reduced marketing cost per acquisition
- Competitive advantage and market share gains
- Foundation for future AI/personalization

## Slide 11: Scenario Analysis - Risk Assessment

### Positive NPV Across All Scenarios

| Scenario | Assumptions | NPV (3yr) | Payback | IRR | Decision |
|----------|-------------|-----------|---------|-----|----------|
| **Best Case** | Benefits +25%, Costs -15% | $9.8M | 12mo | 68% | Strong Go |
| **Likely Case** | Base assumptions | $5.2M | 18mo | 42% | Conditional Go |
| **Worst Case** | Benefits -25%, Costs +25% | $0.8M | 36mo | 12% | Marginal but positive |

**Scenario Details:**

**Best Case:** Onboarding reaches 70%, containment 65%, costs under budget
- Still achievable with good execution
- Represents realistic upside if assumptions conservative

**Likely Case:** Targets met as modeled (65% completion, 50-60% containment)
- Conservative baseline assumptions
- Phased realization curve
- 15% contingency included

**Worst Case:** Onboarding only 55%, containment 40%, 25% cost overrun
- Still NPV positive ($0.8M)
- 36-month payback acceptable
- Demonstrates robust business case

**Key Insight:** Even if everything goes worse than expected, initiative still creates value. Risk of inaction ($30M+ over 3 years) far exceeds implementation risk.

## Slide 12: Sensitivity Analysis - What Matters Most

### Most Impactful Variables Ranked

**Tornado Chart - NPV Impact:**

```
Digital Containment Rate (±10pp)    ████████████ ±$2.5M
Transaction Cost by Channel (±$2)   ██████████ ±$2.0M
Onboarding Volume (±2K/month)       ████████ ±$1.5M
Completion Rate (±10pp)             ███████ ±$1.3M
Implementation Cost (±$1M)          ██████ ±$1.0M
Revenue per Customer (±$50)         ████ ±$0.8M
```

**What This Means:**

**Highest Sensitivity: Digital Containment & Transaction Cost**
- Every 10pp improvement in containment = $2.5M NPV impact
- Every $2 variance in transaction cost = $2.0M NPV impact
- **Action:** Validate transaction costs and volumes in Phase 0 (critical)

**Moderate Sensitivity: Volumes and Completion Rate**
- Application volume and completion rate drive revenue benefit
- Less impactful than cost reduction but still material

**Low Sensitivity: Implementation Cost**
- Cost overruns hurt but are manageable
- Every $1M overrun reduces NPV by ~$1M
- **Action:** Maintain tight cost control with 15% contingency

**Risk Mitigation Focus:**
Validate top 3 variables (containment, cost, volume) in Phase 0 before full commitment.

---

## Slide 14: Critical Success Factors

### What Has to Go Right

**1. Baseline Data Validates Business Case (Weeks 1-4)**
- **Assumption:** Completion rate 40%, containment 20%, volumes 100K/month
- **Risk:** Data shows better current state, reducing benefit opportunity
- **Mitigation:** Accept as good news, adjust targets upward, shift focus to cost reduction
- **Action:** Validate immediately in Phase 0

**2. Pilot Shows Improvement (Month 6-9)**
- **Target:** Minimum 10pp completion improvement, 20pp containment improvement
- **Risk:** Pilot fails to demonstrate value
- **Mitigation:** Realistic targets, multiple iterations, backup plan
- **Action:** Set clear success criteria, measure rigorously, iterate quickly

**3. Digital Adoption Succeeds (Months 7-18)**
- **Challenge:** Past digital initiatives "haven't scaled well"
- **Risk:** Customers and employees don't adopt despite availability
- **Mitigation:** Intensive change management (15-20% of budget), incentives, simple UX, executive mandate
- **Action:** Invest heavily in adoption, not just deployment

**4. Regulatory Clearance for eKYC (Months 0-6)**
- **Requirement:** Banking regulator approval for digital identity verification
- **Risk:** Delays or rejection
- **Mitigation:** Early engagement, compliant vendor, hybrid approach, manual fallback
- **Action:** Schedule regulator meetings in Week 1

**5. Integration and Execution (Months 0-18)**
- **Challenge:** Complex integration with legacy systems
- **Risk:** Cost overruns, delays, quality issues
- **Mitigation:** Technical discovery in Phase 0, API-first, phased rollout, 15% contingency
- **Action:** Conduct architecture review in Month 0-1

---

## Slide 15: Key Risks & Mitigations

### How We Manage Downside Risk

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Baseline data invalidates case** | Benefits -30-50% | Medium | Validate in Phase 0; adjust scope if needed | Still NPV+ in worst case |
| **Digital adoption fails** | Benefits -40%+ | Medium | 15-20% budget to change mgmt, incentives, pilot validation | Assisted-digital fallback |
| **Regulatory delays (eKYC)** | 3-6 month delay | Medium | Early engagement, compliant vendor, hybrid approach | Manual fallback available |
| **Integration complexity** | $2M overrun, 2mo delay | Medium | Technical discovery, API-first, phased, vendor expertise | $1.2M contingency |
| **Pilot shows no improvement** | Delays rollout | Low | Realistic targets, iterations, multiple markets | Pivot approach |

**Risk-Adjusted NPV: $4.0M** (accounting for probability-weighted impacts)

**Overall Risk Profile:**
- **Low-Moderate Risk:** Phased approach with multiple decision gates reduces risk
- **Manageable Downside:** Worst case still NPV positive ($0.8M)
- **Acceptable Trade-Off:** Cost of inaction ($30M+) far exceeds implementation risk

**Risk Management Strategy:**
1. **Phase 0 Validation** - Validate assumptions before major commitment
2. **Pilot Testing** - Prove value in small scope before enterprise scale
3. **Decision Gates** - 3 go/no-go checkpoints (M3, M9, M15) enable course correction
4. **Contingency Budget** - 15% buffer ($1.2M) for unknowns

---

## Slide 16: Recommended Approach - Conditional Go

### Our Recommendation

**CONDITIONAL GO - Proceed with Phased, Risk-Managed Approach**

**Rationale:**
- **Strong ROI:** $5.2M NPV, 42% IRR, 18-month payback
- **Addresses Critical Pain:** Validated by stakeholder evidence (onboarding, servicing, analytics gaps)
- **Conservative Case:** Benefits probability-weighted, 15% contingency included
- **Robust Business Case:** Positive NPV in all scenarios including worst case
- **Strategic Imperative:** Must transform to compete with digital-first banks

**However:** Business case relies on unvalidated assumptions due to data gaps.

**Conditions for Full Approval:**

**Phase 0 (Months 0-3): Validate Before Committing**
1. Validate baseline completion rate, transaction costs, volumes (Weeks 1-4)
2. Obtain regulatory guidance on eKYC approach (Weeks 1-8)
3. Select vendors and finalize architecture (Months 0-3)
4. Present refined business case with validated data at Month 3

**Phase 1 (Months 4-9): Pilot Before Scaling**
5. Launch pilot in one market (1,000+ customers)
6. Validate minimum 10pp completion and 20pp containment improvement
7. Approve full rollout only if pilot successful at Month 9

**Why This Approach:**
- **Validates Assumptions:** Phase 0 confirms business case with data, not assumptions
- **Reduces Risk:** Pilot proves value before $8M enterprise commitment
- **Maintains Flexibility:** 3 decision gates (M3, M9, M15) enable course correction
- **Balances Urgency & Prudence:** Moves quickly but with risk management

---

## Slide 17: Alternative Options Considered

### Why Phased Approach is Best

| Option | Timeline | Investment | NPV | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|----------|------------|-----|------|------|----------------|
| **A: Aggressive (12mo)** | 12 months | $6M | $6.5M | Faster benefits, Lower cost | High execution risk, No pilot, Quality issues | **Not Recommended** |
| **B: Phased (18mo)** | 18 months | $8M | $5.2M | Balanced, Pilot validation, Manageable risk | Slower, Higher cost | **RECOMMENDED** |
| **C: Extended (24mo)** | 24 months | $9M | $4.0M | Lowest risk, Highest quality | Slow, Delayed benefits, High opportunity cost | **Not Recommended** |
| **D: Do Nothing** | N/A | $0 | -$30M+ | No investment | Losing $10M+/year, Competitive decline, Strategic dead end | **Not Viable** |

**Why Option B (Phased 18-Month) is Optimal:**

**vs. Aggressive 12-Month:**
- Bank's track record shows execution challenges (digital "hasn't scaled well")
- Risk of large-scale failure too high given $8M investment
- Pilot validation essential to prevent repeating past mistakes
- $1M NPV difference not worth the risk

**vs. Extended 24-Month:**
- Benefits delayed by 6 months = $4-5M opportunity cost
- Competitive market requires faster response
- 18-month approach already includes 3-month pilot + phased rollout (adequate validation)
- Marginal risk reduction doesn't justify delay

**vs. Do Nothing:**
- Status quo unsustainable in competitive digital-first market
- Cost of inaction ($30M+ over 3 years) exceeds investment
- Strategic imperative to remain competitive

---

## Slide 18: Critical Assumptions Requiring Validation

### What We Need to Confirm in Phase 0

**High-Impact Assumptions - MUST Validate Before Full Approval:**

| Assumption | Assumed Value | Impact on NPV | Validation Owner | Timeline |
|------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| **Current onboarding completion rate** | 40% | ±$1.3M per 10pp | Head of Retail | Weeks 1-2 |
| **Cost per high-cost transaction** | $10 | ±$2.0M per $2 | CFO | Weeks 1-2 |
| **Monthly application volume** | 10,000 | ±$1.0M per 2K | Head of Retail | Weeks 1-2 |
| **Current digital containment** | 20% | ±$2.5M per 10pp | Operations Lead | Weeks 1-2 |

**What Happens If Assumptions Are Wrong:**

**If Baseline BETTER Than Assumed:**
- Example: Completion already 50%, containment already 35%
- Benefits reduced but still positive
- Adjust targets upward (aim for 70% completion, 65% containment)
- Shift focus to cost reduction (more certain opportunity)
- **Action:** Accept as good news, refine scope

**If Baseline WORSE Than Assumed:**
- Example: Completion 30%, containment 10%
- Larger opportunity but more challenging
- May require longer timeline or phased targets
- **Action:** Adjust expectations and phasing

**Validation Approach:**
- Extract data from CRM, core banking, finance, call center systems
- 2-4 week data analysis sprint in Phase 0
- Present refined ROI model to steering committee at Month 3
- Approve/adjust full investment based on validated case

**Confidence Level After Validation:**
Currently MEDIUM confidence → Target HIGH confidence post-validation

- Executive Sponsor: Overall ROI, stakeholder alignment, escalations
- Steering Committee: Strategic decisions, resource allocation, risk management

---

## Slide 21: Why This Matters - Strategic Context

### The Competitive Clock is Ticking

**Market Context:**

**Digital-First Banks Are Not Waiting**
- GXS, Trust Bank, Aspirasi setting new CX standards in SEA
- DBS, CIMB digital raising the bar for regional incumbents
- Customer expectations rising faster than traditional banks can respond
- Every quarter of delay widens the experience gap

**We Are 12-24 Months Behind Competition**
- Current maturity 2.2/5.0 vs. leaders at 4.0+/5.0
- Gap translates to poor customer experience and higher costs
- Digital-savvy customers choosing competitors
- Cannot compete for next generation of banking customers

---

**Strategic Importance:**

**This Is Not Just About Technology or Cost Reduction**
