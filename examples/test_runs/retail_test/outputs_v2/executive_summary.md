**Retail Bank - SEA Region**
**Date:** 2026-01-13

## Investment Recommendation: CONDITIONAL GO

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Investment (5 years)** | $8.6M |
| **Annual Benefit (Steady State)** | $3.4M |
| **Net Present Value (NPV)** | $3.8M |
| **Payback Period** | ~2.5 years |

### One-Sentence Decision Statement

"This initiative requires $8.6M investment over 5 years and is expected to deliver $3.4M in annual recurring benefits, achieving positive NPV with MEDIUM confidence, conditional on validation of key assumptions marked as LOW confidence."

## The Opportunity (Journey-Based)

### Current State: Broken Onboarding, Expensive Servicing

Discovery revealed two critical capability gaps costing the bank revenue and margin:

1. **Onboarding Journey is Broken**
   - Completion rate is "low" with significant drop-off at document stage
   - Cycle time exceeds 7 days in some cases
   - Digital investment hasn't scaled; teams use manual workarounds

2. **Servicing is Expensive**
   - Simple requests still handled by call center
   - No visibility into customer channel behavior
   - Digital self-service underutilized

### Benefits by Journey

| Journey | Revenue | Cost Reduction | Total (Annual) |
|---------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Customer Onboarding | $936,000 | $360,000 | $1,296,000 |
| Customer Servicing | $0 | $2,093,125 | $2,093,125 |
| **TOTAL** | **$936,000** | **$2,453,125** | **$3,389,125** |

## Data Confidence Assessment

### Legend
- 🟢 **HIGH** - From transcript / validated data
- 🟡 **LOW** - Estimate requiring validation
- 🔵 **MEDIUM** - Backbase benchmark

### Critical Assumptions Requiring Validation

| Assumption | Value | Confidence | Owner |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------|
| Monthly application volume | 8,000 | 🟡 LOW | Digital Lead |
| Current completion rate | 40% | 🟢 MED | Digital Lead |
| Revenue per customer (Y1) | $200 | 🟡 LOW | Finance |
| Annual servicing volume | 890,000 | 🟡 LOW | Operations Lead |
| Cost per interaction | $25/hr | 🟡 LOW | Finance |

**Warning:** 4 of 10 core assumptions are marked LOW confidence. Validate before finalizing business case.

## What Would Change This Decision?

### Decision Becomes "No Go" If:

1. Current completion rate is already >55% (less headroom)
2. Servicing volume is <400K annually (smaller opportunity)
3. FTE cost per hour is <$15 (less savings potential)
4. Implementation costs exceed $12M (breakeven at risk)

### External Risks:

1. Regulatory changes to eKYC requirements
2. Core banking modernization conflicts
3. Organizational change resistance (workarounds prevalent)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Validate baseline metrics** - Request data for DG1-DG10 (see Data Gaps sheet in Excel)
2. **Assess existing platform** - Understand current digital capabilities and constraints
3. **Secure executive sponsorship** - Confirm budget and timeline parameters

### Short-term (4-8 Weeks)

1. **Journey mapping workshop** - Detail onboarding friction points with process owners
2. **Channel analytics deep-dive** - Understand servicing volume by type and channel
3. **Vendor assessment** - Confirm Backbase fit and implementation approach

### Execution (Upon Approval)

1. **Phase 1 (0-6 months):** Quick wins - Self-service for top 5 tasks, document upload UX
2. **Phase 2 (6-12 months):** eKYC integration, straight-through processing
3. **Phase 3 (12-18 months):** Journey analytics, personalization
