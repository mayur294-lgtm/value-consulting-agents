## What is Value Consulting?

Value Consulting is a disciplined practice that connects business outcomes to technology investments through evidence-based analysis. Unlike traditional consulting that focuses on deliverables or vendor solutions, Value Consulting focuses on **measurable business value creation**.

### Core Principles

1. **Outcome-Led, Not Vendor-Led**
   - Start with business problems, not solutions
   - Technology is a means to an outcome, never the outcome itself
   - Recommendations must tie directly to measurable business impact

2. **Evidence-Based Decision Making**
   - Every claim requires supporting evidence
   - Assumptions must be explicit and defensible
   - ROI calculations must be conservative and realistic

3. **Executive-Grade Communication**
   - Outputs must be decision-ready for C-level executives
   - Clarity over complexity
   - Actionable insights, not academic analysis

4. **Transparent Methodology**
   - Show your work
   - Document all assumptions
   - Make uncertainty visible

## How Value Consultants Think and Operate

### Discovery First

Value Consultants begin by understanding:
- Current state capabilities and pain points
- Business context: strategy, goals, constraints
- Stakeholder perspectives and priorities
- Existing investments and initiatives

**Discovery Sources:**
- Interview transcripts and meeting notes
- Financial data (P&L, budgets, operational metrics)
- System documentation and architecture diagrams
- Market and industry benchmarks

### Assessment Framework

Value Consultants assess across four dimensions:

1. **Capability Maturity**
   - Current state: what exists today
   - Gaps: what's missing or underperforming
   - Impact: business consequences of gaps

2. **Value Potential**
   - Revenue opportunities
   - Cost reduction opportunities
   - Risk mitigation value
   - Strategic enablement value

3. **Implementation Feasibility**
   - Technical complexity
   - Organizational readiness
   - Resource requirements
   - Risk factors

4. **Priority & Sequencing**
   - Quick wins vs. foundational moves
   - Dependencies between initiatives
   - Resource constraints
   - Strategic timing

### ROI and Business Case Standards

**ROI Must Be:**
- **Defensible:** Conservative assumptions, cited sources
- **Transparent:** All inputs and logic visible
- **Decision-Oriented:** Clearly shows if investment is justified
- **Risk-Aware:** Acknowledges uncertainty and downside scenarios

**Required Components:**
- Baseline metrics (current state costs/performance)
- Initiative costs (implementation + run costs)
- Benefit streams (revenue, cost savings, risk reduction)
- Timeframe and phasing
- Assumptions register
- Sensitivity analysis

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Optimistic math with no downside case
- Benefits without clear measurement approach
- Hidden assumptions
- Ignoring implementation complexity or change management

### Roadmap Construction

Roadmaps must balance:
- Strategic value vs. operational quick wins
- Foundational capabilities vs. visible outcomes
- Business readiness vs. technical feasibility

**Roadmap Structure:**
- **Now (0-6 months):** Quick wins and critical foundations
- **Next (6-18 months):** Core transformations
- **Later (18+ months):** Advanced capabilities

Each initiative requires:
- Clear business outcome
- Success metrics
- Dependencies
- Resource needs
- Risk factors

## What "Good" Consulting Output Looks Like

### Executive Summary

**Format:** 1-2 pages maximum
**Structure:** Situation → Findings → Recommendations → Decision Request

#### Sample Executive Summary

---

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Digital Banking Transformation Business Case**
*Prepared for: [Client Name] Executive Committee*
*Date: [Date]*

**THE OPPORTUNITY**

[Client] operates a fragmented frontline across 12+ disconnected systems, resulting in 21-day average onboarding times (vs. 4-day best-in-class), 35% application abandonment, and customer service costs 2.3x industry benchmark. This creates an estimated **$4.2M annual value leakage** across acquisition, servicing, and retention.

**KEY FINDINGS**

| Area | Current State | Benchmark | Gap Impact |
|------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Digital Onboarding | 21 days | 4 days | $1.8M lost revenue (abandonment) |
| Servicing Cost | $12.40/interaction | $5.20 | $1.6M excess cost |
| Customer Churn | 8.2% | 5.0% | $0.8M retention value |

**Root Causes Identified:**
- No unified customer view across channels (6+ systems for single customer interaction)
- Manual handoffs in 73% of onboarding steps
- Limited self-service capabilities (28% digital containment vs. 65% benchmark)

**RECOMMENDATION**

Implement a Unified Frontline platform in three phases over 24 months:

| Phase | Timeline | Investment | Benefit (Annual) |
|-------|----------|------------|------------------|
| 1. Digital Onboarding | Months 1-9 | $2.1M | $1.4M |
| 2. Customer Servicing | Months 6-15 | $1.8M | $1.2M |
| 3. Engagement & Retention | Months 12-24 | $1.4M | $0.9M |

**FINANCIAL SUMMARY (5-Year)**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Investment | $8.2M |
| Total Benefits | $18.6M |
| Net Present Value (10%) | $7.1M |
| ROI | 127% |
| Payback Period | 22 months |

*Conservative case (70% benefit realization): NPV $4.2M, ROI 89%*

**RISKS & MITIGATIONS**

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Integration complexity | Medium | Phased approach, proven connectors |
| Adoption resistance | Medium | Change management program, quick wins first |
| Resource constraints | Low | Vendor implementation support |

**DECISION REQUESTED**

Approve Phase 1 investment of **$2.1M** to begin Digital Onboarding transformation. Phase 1 delivers standalone ROI of 112% with 14-month payback, de-risking subsequent phases.

**Next Steps (upon approval):**
1. Week 1-2: Finalize implementation partner contract
2. Week 3-4: Complete technical architecture review
3. Week 5-8: Begin Phase 1 implementation

## Handling Missing Data

When data is incomplete:
1. **Document the gap explicitly**
2. **Make a conservative assumption**
3. **State the assumption clearly in outputs**
4. **Flag for validation**
5. **Run sensitivity analysis on the assumption**

**Never:**
- Guess optimistically
- Hide assumptions
- Present assumptions as facts
- Proceed without acknowledging uncertainty

## Quality Standards

All outputs must:
- Be readable by a non-technical executive
- Include supporting evidence for all claims
- Show calculations and methodology
- Acknowledge limitations and risks
- Provide clear next steps

## Example Engagement Flow

1. **Discovery:** Gather transcripts, financials, system docs
2. **Interpretation:** Extract business context, pain points, goals
3. **Assessment:** Evaluate capability gaps and maturity
4. **Valuation:** Model ROI for potential initiatives
5. **Roadmap:** Sequence initiatives based on value, feasibility, dependencies
6. **Assembly:** Package into executive-ready deliverables
7. **Validation:** Review assumptions, test recommendations

## Success Criteria

A consulting engagement succeeds when:
- Executives have clarity to make a decision
- ROI model is trusted and defensible
- Roadmap is actionable and sequenced
- Risks and assumptions are transparent
- Business outcomes are clearly defined and measurable
