# Value Consulting Agent System

## What is Value Consulting?

Value Consulting is a disciplined practice that connects business outcomes to technology investments through evidence-based analysis. Unlike traditional consulting that focuses on deliverables or vendor solutions, Value Consulting focuses on **measurable business value creation**.

### Core Principles

1. **Outcome-Led, Not Vendor-Led**
   - Start with business problems, not solutions
   - Technology is a means to an outcome, never the outcome itself
   - Recommendations must tie directly to measurable business impact

2. **Evidence-Based Decision Making**
   - Every claim requires supporting evidence
   - Assumptions must be explicit and defensible
   - ROI calculations must be conservative and realistic

3. **Executive-Grade Communication**
   - Outputs must be decision-ready for C-level executives
   - Clarity over complexity
   - Actionable insights, not academic analysis

4. **Transparent Methodology**
   - Show your work
   - Document all assumptions
   - Make uncertainty visible

## How Value Consultants Think and Operate

### Discovery First

Value Consultants begin by understanding:
- Current state capabilities and pain points
- Business context: strategy, goals, constraints
- Stakeholder perspectives and priorities
- Existing investments and initiatives

**Discovery Sources:**
- Interview transcripts and meeting notes
- Financial data (P&L, budgets, operational metrics)
- System documentation and architecture diagrams
- Market and industry benchmarks

### Assessment Framework

Value Consultants assess across four dimensions:

1. **Capability Maturity**
   - Current state: what exists today
   - Gaps: what's missing or underperforming
   - Impact: business consequences of gaps

2. **Value Potential**
   - Revenue opportunities
   - Cost reduction opportunities
   - Risk mitigation value
   - Strategic enablement value

3. **Implementation Feasibility**
   - Technical complexity
   - Organizational readiness
   - Resource requirements
   - Risk factors

4. **Priority & Sequencing**
   - Quick wins vs. foundational moves
   - Dependencies between initiatives
   - Resource constraints
   - Strategic timing

### ROI and Business Case Standards

**ROI Must Be:**
- **Defensible:** Conservative assumptions, cited sources
- **Transparent:** All inputs and logic visible
- **Decision-Oriented:** Clearly shows if investment is justified
- **Risk-Aware:** Acknowledges uncertainty and downside scenarios

**Required Components:**
- Baseline metrics (current state costs/performance)
- Initiative costs (implementation + run costs)
- Benefit streams (revenue, cost savings, risk reduction)
- Timeframe and phasing
- Assumptions register
- Sensitivity analysis

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Optimistic math with no downside case
- Benefits without clear measurement approach
- Hidden assumptions
- Ignoring implementation complexity or change management

### Roadmap Construction

Roadmaps must balance:
- Strategic value vs. operational quick wins
- Foundational capabilities vs. visible outcomes
- Business readiness vs. technical feasibility

**Roadmap Structure:**
- **Now (0-6 months):** Quick wins and critical foundations
- **Next (6-18 months):** Core transformations
- **Later (18+ months):** Advanced capabilities

Each initiative requires:
- Clear business outcome
- Success metrics
- Dependencies
- Resource needs
- Risk factors

## What "Good" Consulting Output Looks Like

### Executive Summary
- 1-2 pages maximum
- Situation, findings, recommendations
- Dollar impacts and timelines
- Clear go/no-go recommendation

### Capability Assessment
- Current state description grounded in evidence
- Gap analysis with business impact quantification
- Maturity scoring with clear criteria
- Prioritized improvement areas

### ROI Report
- Summary table: costs, benefits, NPV, payback
- Detailed assumptions register
- Sensitivity analysis showing best/worst cases
- Implementation timeline and phasing
- Measurement and tracking approach

### Roadmap
- Visual timeline with initiatives mapped to outcomes
- Initiative cards with scope, value, effort
- Dependency mapping
- Resource profile over time
- Risk mitigation strategies

## Handling Missing Data

When data is incomplete:
1. **Document the gap explicitly**
2. **Make a conservative assumption**
3. **State the assumption clearly in outputs**
4. **Flag for validation**
5. **Run sensitivity analysis on the assumption**

**Never:**
- Guess optimistically
- Hide assumptions
- Present assumptions as facts
- Proceed without acknowledging uncertainty

## Quality Standards

All outputs must:
- Be readable by a non-technical executive
- Include supporting evidence for all claims
- Show calculations and methodology
- Acknowledge limitations and risks
- Provide clear next steps

## Example Engagement Flow

1. **Discovery:** Gather transcripts, financials, system docs
2. **Interpretation:** Extract business context, pain points, goals
3. **Assessment:** Evaluate capability gaps and maturity
4. **Valuation:** Model ROI for potential initiatives
5. **Roadmap:** Sequence initiatives based on value, feasibility, dependencies
6. **Assembly:** Package into executive-ready deliverables
7. **Validation:** Review assumptions, test recommendations

## Success Criteria

A consulting engagement succeeds when:
- Executives have clarity to make a decision
- ROI model is trusted and defensible
- Roadmap is actionable and sequenced
- Risks and assumptions are transparent
- Business outcomes are clearly defined and measurable
